# Component-based Rails Applications (CBRA) - Source Code to the Book

This repository holds all source code used in my book on [Component-based Rails Applications](http://cbra.info).

## How to use this repository

The repository is organized by book chapter and section. If a section adds no code that is specific to it, it may use the source code from the last section preceding it that does have source code samples attached (Section 2.3 is an example of this).

The paths to files given in the book assume the root of the application or gem being the current directory.

## Feedback

Please let me know if you find any errors in the code!
